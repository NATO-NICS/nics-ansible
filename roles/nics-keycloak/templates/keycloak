## Update '-Xms' and '-Xmx' to be half the memory available on your server if it's dedicated to only serving Keycloak.
## You will want to reduce it if you are running PostgreSQL on the same server or other Java processes using garbage collection.
## '-Xs' can be removed if you'd like the server to start quickly for development but it's not best practice for running in production since it will stutter when increasing heap size.
